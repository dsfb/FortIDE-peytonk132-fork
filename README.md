# FortIDE
This is a simple Fortran-dedicated IDE im making. This is the Reddit post kind of describing the things I want to do and a run down of who I am: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1c0bat6/making_a_simple_ide_for_fortran

This is mostly going to be a conglomeration of different libraries with some of my functionalites put in. the current libs that are used here are as follows:

SFML:
https://github.com/SFML/SFML

ImGui:
https://github.com/ocornut/imgui

NativeFileDialog(NFD):
https://github.com/mlabbe/nativefiledialog
